To install:
python setup.py build
and
python setup.py install

To also install the optional LOFAR features (requires lofar.parmdb + pyrap):

python setup.py build --add-lofar-utils
python setup.py install --add-lofar-utils



For installation without root access use --prefix=<local directory> for the install step, eg.

python setup.py install --add-lofar-utils --prefix=$HOME

make sure $HOME/bin is in your PATH and
$HOME/lib/<pythonversion>/site-packages in PYTHONPATH. Also note that this directory should be created if it does not exist before running setup.py, eg.

mkdir -p $HOME/lib/<pythonversion>/site-packages

Also note that some systems will use lib64 in stead of lib.
