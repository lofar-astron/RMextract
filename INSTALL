It is strongly recommended to install RMextract in a python virtual environment:

$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate


To install from source, go to the root of the source tree and run:

$ pip install .


To also install the optional LOFAR features (requires lofar.parmdb + losoto):

$ pip install .[lofar-utils]


Notes:
- When building from source, you need to have a working Fortran and C++ compiler.
- If, for whatever reason, you need to install python-casacore from source,
  you need to have casacore and Boost.Python installed.
