SELECTED GEOMAGNETIC AND SOLAR ACTIVITY INDICES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WORLDWIDE INDICES--------------------------------------------------------------
The subscript "p" means planetary and designates a global magnetic activity in-
dex.  The following 13 observatories, which lie between 46 and 63 degrees north
and south geomagnetic latitude, now contribute to the planetary indices: Ler-
wick (UK), Eskdalemuir (UK), Hartland (UK), Ottawa (Canada), Fredericksburg
(USA), Meannook (Canada), Sitka (USA), Eyrewell (New Zealand), Canberra (Aus-
tralia), Lovo (Sweden), Brorfelde (Denmark), Wingst (Germany), and Niemegk
(Germany).


THREE-HOUR-RANGE INDEX K-------------------------------------------------------
K indices isolate solar particle effects on the earth's magnetic field; over a
3-hour period, they classify into disturbance levels the range of variation of
the more unsettled horizontal field component.  Each activity level relates al-
most logarithmically to its corresponding disturbance amplitude.  Three-hour
indices discriminate conservatively between true magnetic field perturbations
and the quiet-day variations produced by ionospheric currents.

K indices range in 28 steps from 0 (quiet) to 9 (greatly disturbed) with frac-
tional parts expressed in thirds of a unit.  A K-value equal to 27, for exam-
ple, means 2 and 2/3 or 3-; a K-value equal to 30 means 3 and 0/3 or 3 exactly;
and a K-value equal to 33 means 3 and 1/3 or 3+.  The arithmetic mean of the K
values scaled at the 13 observatories listed above gives Kp.


EQUIVALENT AMPLITUDE-----------------------------------------------------------
The a-index ranges from 0 to 400 and represents a K-value converted to a linear
scale in gammas (nanoTeslas)--a scale that measures equivalent disturbance am-
plitude of a station at which K=9 has a lower limit of 400 gammas.

66-70     F5.1  OTTAWA 10.7-CM SOLAR RADIO FLUX ADJUSTED TO 1 AU--measured at
                  1700 UT daily and expressed in units of 10 to the -22 Watts/
                  meter sq/hertz.  Observations began on February 14, 1947. 
                  From that date through December 31, 1973, the fluxes given
                  here don't reflect the revisions Ottawa made in 1966. NOTE: 
                  If a solar radio burst is in progress during the observation
                  the pre-noon or afternoon value is used (as indicated by a
                  flux qualifier value of 1 in column 71.

71-71     I1    FLUX QUALIFIER.  "0" indicates flux required no adjustment; 
                  "1" indicates flux required adjustment for burst in progress
                  at time of measurement; "2" indicates a flux approximated by
                  either interpolation or extrapolation; and "3" indicates no
                  observation.
